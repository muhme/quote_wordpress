Displays a random quote from user community. Configurable with author, user, category, language (English, German, Spanish, Japanese or Ukrainian).

== Description ==

The WordPress plugin is a Block Editor Widget that displays a random quote from the collection of the user community [zitat-service.de/en](https://www.zitat-service.de/en). The selection of quotes comes from the five languages German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, Japanese ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ or Ukrainian ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦. We have been online free of charge and without advertising since 2007.

Detailed instructions on installation and configuration can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/muhme/quote_wordpress/wiki).

There is a WordPress demo installation with plugin *Random Quote from Zitat-Service* running online at [wp-demo.zitat-service.de](https://wp-demo.zitat-service.de).

== Usage of External API.zitat-service.de ==

The WordPress plugin fetches all data from [api.zitat-service.de](https://api.zitat-service.de). Terms of use and privacy statement can be found in the [Imprint](https://www.zitat-service.de/en/start/contact).

The random quotes of the WordPress website (frontend) are retrieved by PHP code running on the WordPress server (backend). This means that the process of retrieving quotes does not involve tracking or recording any user-specific data. Instead, it operates within the server environment, ensuring user privacy and compliance with guidelines that prohibit tracking users without their consent.

The displayed quotes, along with their respective authors and sources, are linked externally to websites such as zitat-service.de and Wikipedia to provide users with additional context and information. All external links are activated only after manual verification by the admin team at zitat-service.de, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the linked content.
